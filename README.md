# Pokedex

This is a xamarin forms app written in C#/.Net inspired by the classic pokemon game. My main goal was to practice building a mobile application in xamarin forms with focus on the xaml markup language. As well as understanding how you can work with restful apiÂ´s.

* It is optimized for running on android.

I used the restful API at https://pokeapi.co/ with an api-wrapper from github user https://github.com/mtrdp642/PokeApiNet.
