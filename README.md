# Pokedex

This is a xamarin forms app written in C#/.Net inspired by the classic pokemon game. My main goal was to practice building a mobile application with xamarin forms with focus on the xaml markup language.

I used the restful API https://pokeapi.co/ with a .Net wrapper from github user https://github.com/mtrdp642/PokeApiNet.
